# DeCode: The Interview-Based Study Game

This is the code for **DeCode**, a text-based JavaScript game I built to reinforce advanced JS fundamentals while creating a playful tool to prepare for technical interviews.

The premise is simple:
You’re heading into an interview at *TerryTech*… but your dog chewed up the answer sections of your cue cards the night before! Now, you’ll have to unscramble words, rely on context clues, and battle **ANXIETY** itself to prove your skills and land the job.

Along the way, I challenged myself to implement higher-order functions, closures, recursion, and modular code organization — all while keeping the gameplay engaging.

## Features

* **Interactive Dialogue System**: Branching welcome flow, rules, and narrative setup.
* **Word-Scramble Gameplay**: Unscramble chewed-up answers with up to three guesses.
* **Scoring & Game States**: Win, lose, or stay in the pool depending on your performance.
* **Skip Mechanic**: Use one skip per game… choose wisely.
* **Review Mode**: Second chances on missed questions with dynamic feedback.
* **Humorous Alerts**: Balance of **SELF-ESTEEM** boosts and **ANXIETY** jabs.

## Purpose

* Reinforce my knowledge of **advanced JavaScript** fundamentals.
* Practice **control flow, conditionals, closures, recursion, and modularization**.
* Build a small but meaningful project from scratch that solves a real-world challenge: practicing for technical interviews in a fun way.

## How to Run

### Step 1

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anddude/decode-game.git
```

### Step 2

Open the project folder in your code editor:

```bash
cd decode-game
```

### Step 3

Run the game in your browser by simply opening the `index.html` file.
(There’s no build process — just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)

### Step 4

When the page loads, the game will start automatically. All interaction happens through **alert**, **prompt**, and **confirm** popups.

## Notes

* This project is deliberately **unstyled** in HTML/CSS — the challenge was to focus on JavaScript only.
* Gameplay is **single-player**, played entirely in-browser with native dialogs.
* The study guide at the end provides a custom recap of missed questions, turning mistakes into learning opportunities.
